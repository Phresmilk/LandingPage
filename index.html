    <p>My husband LOVES food that is almost edible, and I have to say it's grown on me. Or at least somethign is growing on me!</p>
    <p>This is my favorite depression food, it's definitely the taste you think of when you think... purgatory! It's not alive but it's not dead either, but it's definitely not meat. </p>
    <p>Listen if this the meat of the future, and trust me I believe it is, don't look for me in the future. Because I'll be right here, in this moment eating this slop.</p>
    <p>My disc golf team has had such wonderful success with the patties. Great weight, aerodynamics, and if we're being completely honest it's just quality almost meat.</p>

<div class="quote-section"><p class="quote-maintext">“If you ask me, our planet and our entire lives are a [virtual] construct of our own minds and the mind at large. If we were to decode the COVID-19 message coming from the transcendent realm, I would approximate it as: ‘The next phase of human evolution is clearly in the cards now: Consuming synthetic meat and being open to the connectivity explosion with immersive virtual worlds not for escapism but for expansion of the human creative imagination should become a conscientious choice for billions. The ‘Cradle Age’ is almost over.” </p><p class="quoted-person">Alex M. Vikoulov</p></div>
